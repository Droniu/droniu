👨‍💻 I'm a software enginner specializing in **TypeScript**, with an engineering degree in Computer Science issued by [WUST](https://pwr.edu.pl/en/).

Currently working as React Developer in [Saleor Commerce](https://saleor.io/) 🚀

I have commercial experience in:
- building cutting edge **web applications for e-commerce**
- developing UI libraries
- working with GraphQL API

In my free time I like to expand my knowledge in various areas of computer science doing side projects, acquiring some experience in:
- Next.js applications
- Serverless applications using sst framework and AWS ecosystem (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3)
- Deep learning - my engineering thesis was implementation of a medical chatbot, in ChatGPT style
- Old-school game development in 6502 assembly

I believe in **flexible remote-first approach**, **delivery-driven development** and **quality communication**.
